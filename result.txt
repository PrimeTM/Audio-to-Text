Pain is constant and sharp and i do not hope for a better world for anyone in fact i want my pain to be inflicted on others i want no one to escape but even after admitting this. Catharsis my punishment continues to elude me and i gain no deeper knowledge of myself and new knowledge can be extracted from my telling this confession has meant nothing.
